# Geo i18n Game – Frontend Test Task

Production-oriented React application built with a fully custom Webpack setup.

---

## 🚀 Project Summary

This project was built as a technical assessment for a Middle Frontend Developer position.

The goal was not only to deliver a working UI, but to demonstrate:

- Strong understanding of build tooling (Webpack + Babel)
- Clean architectural decisions
- Performance awareness
- Manual internationalization without external routing or i18n libraries
- Scalable component structure
- Production-ready code standards

No scaffolding tools (CRA, Vite) were used intentionally.

---

## 🧱 Tech Stack

### Core

- React 18
- TypeScript 5 (strict mode)
- Webpack 5 (custom configuration)
- Babel

### UI & Styling

- MUI v7
- styled-components (via `@mui/styled-engine-sc`)
- Responsive layout system

### Quality & Tooling

- ESLint (React + TypeScript rules)
- Prettier
- Type-safe configuration
- Clean build output with content hashing

---

## 🏗 Architectural Highlights

### 1️⃣ Custom Webpack Configuration

- Manual entry/output configuration
- Content-hashed production bundles
- Clean build directory
- Proper publicPath handling
- Babel + TypeScript integration
- Styled-components optimization plugin

Demonstrates understanding beyond framework defaults.

### 2️⃣ Manual Internationalization (No Libraries)

- No `react-router`
- No `react-i18next`
- No external routing solution
